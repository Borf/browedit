 * Encryption types:
 * GRFFILE_FLAG_0x14_DES - Only the first 20 blocks (160 bytes)
 *				of the compressed file are encrypted
 * GRFFILE_FLAG_MIXCRYPT - The first 20 blocks of the compressed file are
 *				encrypted, as well as every Xth block
 *				(where X is based on the number of digits in
 *				 the compressed file size before encryption)
 *				and every 7th unencrypted block has its
 *				bytes reordered and modified.
